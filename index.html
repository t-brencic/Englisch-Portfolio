  <h2>Portfolio Entry #1 – Summer Update</h2>

  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Windsurfing:</strong> I went windsurfing during summer. It was harder than it looks, but very fun. Balance and control are important.</li>
    <li><strong>Training:</strong> I trained a lot in the gym, running, and BJJ. I tried to stay consistent even on hard days.</li>
    <li><strong>Birthday:</strong> I turned 18. This was a big milestone and I also got my firefighter pager.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Lowlight</h3>
  <p>
    I lost in training against someone with more experience.
    It was frustrating, but also kind of funny 🤣.
  </p>

  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>
    Train more and stay disciplined. Losing shows where I need to improve.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="e2">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #2 – English Around the World</h2>

  <p>
    I chose Australia. Australian English is known for slang and short words.
    The language sounds relaxed and friendly.
  </p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mate</strong> – friend</li>
    <li><strong>Arvo</strong> – afternoon</li>
    <li><strong>Brekky</strong> – breakfast</li>
    <li><strong>No worries</strong> – no problem</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Australian English fits well with sport and outdoor lifestyle.
  </p>

<section id="e3">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #3 – Emotions</h2>

  <h3>Disappointed</h3>
  <p>
    During some BJJ competitions, I felt disappointed.
    I trained hard and still lost fights I thought I could win.
    Losing in competition feels much worse than losing in training.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the matches, I thought a lot about my mistakes.
    Small details made the difference.
    Even though it was frustrating, it helped me see where I need to improve.
  </p>

  <h3>Delighted</h3>
  <p>
    I also felt delighted when I won fights.
    Stepping on the mat, staying calm, and performing well gave me confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Competing helped me grow mentally and physically.
  </p>

<section id="e4">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #4 – Conditional Story</h2>

  <p>
    If I hadn’t competed in BJJ this year, I would have stayed in my comfort zone.
    I wouldn’t have learned how to deal with pressure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because I did compete, I improved faster.
    Every match showed me what works and what doesn’t.
  </p>

<section id="e5">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #5 – Wishes</h2>

  <h3>Present</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I wish I had more time for training and school.</li>
    <li>I wish I were always fully recovered.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Annoying things</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I wish distractions would stop when I want to focus.</li>
    <li>I wish injuries wouldn’t slow me down.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Past regrets</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I wish I hadn’t ignored mobility training before.</li>
    <li>I wish I had planned some projects earlier.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="e6">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #6 – Tap Water</h2>

  <p>
    I believe tap water should be free in Swiss restaurants.
    You already pay for food, so water should be included.
  </p>

  <p>
    Swiss tap water is clean and high quality.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="e7">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #7 – Tariffs</h2>

  <p>
    Tariffs can help local businesses but also make products more expensive.
    For small brands, this can be a problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trade should be fair and well thought out.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="e8">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #8 – Deepfakes</h2>

  <p>
    Deepfakes are AI-generated videos that look very real.
    They can be useful, but also dangerous.
  </p>

  <p>
    For people working online, protecting your image is important.
  </p>

  <h2>Portfolio Entry #9 – Best of 2025</h2>

  <p>
    I listened to Bad Bunny from the Pitchfork list.
    Some songs were in my BJJ playlists.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most albums are too slow for me.
    I prefer fast music with energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The song I listened to the most is <strong>The King's Affirmation by Iniko</strong>.
    I use it before competitions and during solo training.
  </p>

  <h3>Best things of 2025</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Getting more sponsors</li>
    <li>Becoming a firefighter</li>
    <li>Good BJJ competitions</li>
    <li>Signing my first agency</li>
    <li>Growing closer with my girlfriend</li>
  </ul>
