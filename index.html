        <span class="tag tag--highlight">Summer</span>
        <span class="tag">Sport</span>
        <span class="tag">Personal Growth</span>

        <h3>Highlights</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Windsurfing:</strong> I spent time on the water, fighting with the wind and trying to control the sail. It was challenging, but the feeling of gliding over the lake was worth it.</li>
          <li><strong>Training:</strong> I kept working on my hybrid athlete lifestyle: strength training, running, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Even in the heat, I tried to stay consistent.</li>
          <li><strong>Birthday:</strong> I celebrated my 18th birthday, which was an important milestone. Turning 18 also meant new responsibilities, especially as a firefighter and first responder.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lowlight</h3>
        <p>
          In training, I did not win against someone with more experience. It was a bit frustrating
          and also funny at the same time because I gave my best and still got destroyed 🤣.
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The only real solution is simple: <strong>train more</strong>. Losing to people with more experience
          shows me exactly where I need to improve. It motivates me to come back stronger next time.

          <div class="entry-meta">Australian English – slang and identity</div>
        </div>

        <span class="tag tag--highlight">English Around the World</span>
        <span class="tag">Australia</span>

        <p>
          For this entry, I chose <strong>Australian English</strong>. It is famous for its relaxed
          pronunciation, unique slang, and short forms of words. Many of these expressions show the
          Australian lifestyle: informal, direct, and friendly.
        </p>

        <h3>Slang &amp; examples</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>“Arvo”</strong> – afternoon.  
            Example: “Let’s train this arvo before it gets too hot.”</li>
          <li><strong>“Mate”</strong> – friend / buddy, used all the time, even with strangers.  
            Example: “Thanks, mate!”</li>
          <li><strong>“No worries”</strong> – it’s okay, no problem.  
            Example: “No worries, mate, we can do it tomorrow.”</li>
          <li><strong>“Brekky”</strong> – breakfast.  
            Example: “I need a good brekky before my run.”</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Australian English often cuts words short and adds <strong>-o</strong> or <strong>-y/-ie</strong>. This gives
          the language a friendly rhythm. If I ever visit Australia, I will probably hear more slang on the
          street than in any textbook.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          For me as someone who likes sport and outdoor life, Australian English feels close to my world:
          relaxed, direct, and always ready for another training session in the sun.

            <h3>Devastated – breaking my wrist</h3>
            <p>
              Last season when I tried snowboarding, I fell and broke my wrist. At that time I was very focused
              on training and performance, so this injury felt like a disaster. I was <strong>devastated</strong> because
              I had to stop a lot of things: lifting weights, doing BJJ properly, and progressing like I had planned.
            </p>
            <p>
              The injury reminded me that one bad moment can change months of training. But it also taught me patience,
              discipline in recovery, and respect for my body.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Delighted – becoming a firefighter &amp; getting sponsors</h3>
            <p>
              Another strong emotion for me in 2025 was feeling <strong>delighted</strong> and proud. I received my pager
              as a firefighter when I turned 18, which made my role as a first responder official. It was a big step in
              responsibility and service to my community.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time, I managed to sign more sponsors and even an agency to help manage them. As a young
              hybrid athlete, being taken seriously by brands was a huge confirmation that my hard work is visible.

          If I <strong>hadn't broken</strong> my wrist while snowboarding, I <strong>would have spent</strong> the whole winter
          season on the slopes and I probably <strong>wouldn't have learned</strong> so much about patience and recovery.
        </p>

        <p>
          If I hadn’t taken that fall, my winter would have looked very different. I would have kept pushing my
          body hard almost every day – snowboarding, training, and maybe overdoing it. I would have focused mainly
          on speed and performance, not on long-term health.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because I did break my wrist, I was forced to slow down. I spent more time working on mental strength,
          planning my Elba Island project, and learning how important mobility and prehab are.  
          In the end, if I hadn't had this injury, I might have stayed the same. With it, I had to grow.

        <h3>Two wishes for annoying things</h3>

          <div class="entry-title">Portfolio Entry #6 – Tap Water in Swiss Restaurants</div>
          <div class="entry-meta">Should it be free?</div>
        </div>

        <span class="tag tag--highlight">Discussion</span>
        <span class="tag">Switzerland</span>

        <p>
          I believe tap water should be free in Swiss restaurants. The main reason is that when you go out to eat,
          you are already paying for a meal and often for other drinks too. Some fresh water from the tap should
          always be included as a basic service.
        </p>

        <p>
          Switzerland has very high-quality drinking water. It makes little sense to charge extra for something
          that is already safe and available everywhere. Free tap water could also encourage people to drink less
          sugary drinks, which would be better for their health.
        </p>

        <p>
          Personally, I would probably order more water if it was free. For someone who trains a lot and cares
          about performance and health, staying hydrated is essential. Having easy access to water in restaurants
          would support that lifestyle without making everything more expensive.

          <div class="entry-title">Portfolio Entry #7 – Tariffs and Small Brands</div>
          <div class="entry-meta">Thinking beyond the “caveman” level</div>
        </div>

        <span class="tag tag--highlight">Tariffs</span>
        <span class="tag">Business</span>

        <p>
          As someone who works with sponsors and is interested in business, I see tariffs as something that can
          both protect and hurt companies. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. In theory, they can protect local
          businesses from cheap foreign products. But they can also make it harder for small brands to grow
          internationally.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, if a small Swiss brand wants to sell products abroad, tariffs can make their items more
          expensive and less attractive for customers in another country. On the other hand, if Switzerland
          places tariffs on foreign products, it might help local producers but also raise prices for consumers.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my opinion, we should stop “acting like cavemen” and only thinking in simple “good vs. bad”.
          Tariffs are a tool. The real question is how to design trade rules so that they support innovation,
          fair competition, and small companies – not only big corporations.

        <span class="tag tag--highlight">Technology</span>
        <span class="tag">AI &amp; Media</span>

        <p>
          In this task I worked with a deepfake-style video using an AI tool (HeyGen). The idea of deepfakes is
          that artificial intelligence can create very realistic videos of people saying or doing things they
          never actually said or did.
        </p>

        <p>
          These tools can be used for positive things, for example to create content faster, to localize
          marketing videos, or to make fun short clips. But they also have a dangerous side: people can use
          them to spread fake news, to damage someone’s reputation, or to create illegal content.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          As someone active on social media and working with sponsors, deepfakes are a serious topic for me.
          Protecting my identity and my image online is becoming more and more important as AI tools get better.

        <span class="tag">2025 Highlights</span>

        <h3>Pitchfork’s Best Albums of 2025</h3>
        <p>
          From Pitchfork’s list (for example <em>Los Thuthanaka</em>, Dijon’s <em>Baby</em>, Bad Bunny’s
          <em>DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS</em>, or Oklou’s <em>Choke Enough</em>), I have listened to Bad Bunny.
          A few of his songs were in the playlist I used in the BJJ classes I gave.
        </p>

        <p>
          In general, I do not really like most of the albums on that list. I find many of them too slow.  
          For training, I need music with <strong>energy, high pace, and strong beats</strong>. If the song
          does not push me, it does not stay in my playlist.
        </p>

        <h3>An album/song that should be on the list</h3>
        <p>
          One song from 2025 that I think deserves more attention is <strong>“The King's Affirmation” by Iniko</strong>.
          It is not just a normal track for me. It became a tool:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Before competitions, I use it to calm myself down and focus.</li>
          <li>When I train alone, I often play a mixed version of the song.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sometimes I play it on repeat for hours. It puts me into a mental state where I feel confident and centred.
        </p>

        <h3>The best things of 2025 for me</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Getting more big sponsors:</strong> I am proud that more brands decided to support me as an athlete.</li>
          <li><strong>Becoming an official firefighter:</strong> I received my pager when I turned 18, which was a huge step in responsibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Great fights and competitions:</strong> I had several strong performances in BJJ and continued growing as a fighter.</li>
          <li><strong>Signing with my first agency:</strong> A professional agency now helps me manage sponsors and projects.</li>
          <li><strong>Growing closer with my girlfriend:</strong> We got together just before 2025, and this year we became even closer. She supported me through competitions, injuries, and of course with food.</li>
        </ul>
