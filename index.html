  <h2>Portfolio Entry #1 – Summer Update</h2>

  <h3>Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Windsurfing:</strong> I went windsurfing.</li>
    <li><strong>Training:</strong> I trained a lot. Gym, running and BJJ. I tried to stay consistent.</li>
    <li><strong>Birthday:</strong> I turned 18, which was a big step for me. I also got my pager as a firefighter.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Lowlight</h3>
  <p>
    I lost in training against someone with more experience.  
    It was annoying but also kind of funny 🤣.
  </p>

  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>
    Train more.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="e2">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #2 – English Around the World</h2>

  <p>
    I chose <strong>Australia</strong>. Australian English is known for slang and short words.
    People speak very relaxed and friendly.
  </p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Mate</strong> – friend (used all the time)</li>
    <li><strong>Arvo</strong> – afternoon</li>
    <li><strong>Brekky</strong> – breakfast</li>
    <li><strong>No worries</strong> – no problem</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Australian English fits well to sport and outdoor lifestyle.
    It sounds casual and direct.
  </p>

<section id="e3">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #3 – Emotions</h2>

  <h3>Devastated</h3>
  <p>
    When I broke my wrist snowboarding, I felt devastated.
    I couldn’t train properly and had to slow down.
    It was frustrating because sport is very important to me.
  </p>

  <h3>Delighted</h3>
  <p>
    I felt delighted when I got my firefighter pager and when I signed sponsors.
    It showed me that my work and discipline are paying off.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="e4">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #4 – Conditional Story</h2>

  <p>
    If I hadn’t broken my wrist, I would have continued training without a break.
    I probably wouldn’t have learned how important recovery and mobility are.
  </p>

  <p>
    The injury slowed me down, but it also made me smarter in training.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="e5">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #5 – Wishes</h2>

  <h3>Present</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I wish I had more time for everything.</li>
    <li>I wish I were already fully injury-free.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Annoying things</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I wish distractions would stop when I need to focus.</li>
    <li>I wish small injuries wouldn’t keep coming back.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Past regrets</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I wish I hadn’t ignored mobility work before.</li>
    <li>I wish I had started some projects earlier.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="e6">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #6 – Tap Water</h2>

  <p>
    I believe tap water should be free in Swiss restaurants.
    You already pay for food, so water should be included.
  </p>

  <p>
    Swiss tap water is very clean and high quality.
    Free water would also be healthier for people.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="e7">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #7 – Tariffs</h2>

  <p>
    Tariffs can help local businesses, but they can also make products more expensive.
    For small brands, tariffs can be a big problem when selling internationally.
  </p>

  <p>
    We should think smart about trade and not just in simple black-and-white ways.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="e8">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #8 – Deepfakes</h2>

  <p>
    Deepfakes are videos made with AI that look very real.
    They can be useful, but also dangerous.
  </p>

  <p>
    For people who work online and with sponsors, protecting your image is very important.
  </p>

<section id="e9">
  <h2>Portfolio Entry #9 – Best of 2025</h2>

  <p>
    I listened to Bad Bunny from the Pitchfork list.
    Some songs were in my BJJ class playlists.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t like most albums from the list because they are too slow.
    I need fast music with energy and strong beats.
  </p>

  <p>
    A song I listened to the most is <strong>The King's Affirmation by Iniko</strong>.
    I use it before competitions and when training alone.
    Sometimes I play it on repeat for hours.
  </p>

  <h3>Best things of 2025</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Getting more big sponsors</li>
    <li>Becoming a firefighter</li>
    <li>Great fights and competitions</li>
    <li>Signing my first agency</li>
    <li>Growing closer with my girlfriend</li>
  </ul>
